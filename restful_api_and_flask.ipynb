        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "ans:- A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web service that follows the principles of REST, an architectural style for designing networked applications. It allows different systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "ans:- An API specification is a formal, structured document that describes how an API behaves and how clients should interact with it. It defines the rules, endpoints, request formats, response structures, authentication methods, and other technical details needed to use the API correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "ans:- Flask is a lightweight, open-source web framework written in Python, designed to make it easy to build web applications and APIs quickly. Itâ€™s particularly popular for building RESTful APIs because of its simplicity, flexibility, and minimalism.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "ans:- Routing in Flask refers to the process of defining URL patterns (routes) that are linked to specific functions (called view functions) which handle the logic and response for those URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simpler terms, routing tells Flask what code to run when a user accesses a particular URL in your web app or API.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "ans:- pip install flask\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "ans :- In RESTful APIs, HTTP methods define the type of operation a client wants to perform on a resource. Here are the most commonly used methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ”¹ 1. GET\n",
        "Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Safe: Yes (doesnâ€™t modify anything).\n",
        "\n",
        "Idempotent: Yes (same result if called multiple times).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "GET /users/1 â†’ Fetch user with ID 1.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask\n",
        "ans:- The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to associate a URL path with a function, so that when a user visits that path in their browser (or makes an HTTP request to it), Flask knows which function to run and what response to return.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ Purpose:\n",
        "It creates a route, which is a mapping between:\n",
        "\n",
        "A URL pattern (like /, /about, or /user/<id>)\n",
        "\n",
        "A view function (Python function that returns a response).\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "ans:- The GET and POST HTTP methods are both used to communicate with a server, but they serve different purposes and behave differently:\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ”¹ GET\n",
        "Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Visible in URL: Yes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Case: Reading or searching information without changing server data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cacheable: Yes (can be cached by browsers and proxies).\n",
        "\n",
        "Idempotent: Yes (same request gives same result, no side effects).\n",
        "\n",
        "Request Body: Not used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Request Body: Yes (usually JSON or form data).\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "ans:- n Flask APIs, handling errors properly ensures that your application responds with clear, consistent messages and appropriate HTTP status codes when something goes wrong. Hereâ€™s how you can handle errors in Flask:\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… 1. Using abort()\n",
        "The abort() function stops the request and sends an HTTP error code.\n",
        "\n",

        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database\n",
        "ans:- To connect Flask to a SQL database, the most common and recommended way is by using SQLAlchemy, which is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that lets you interact with the database using Python classes instead of raw SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "ans. Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that simplifies integrating SQLAlchemy (a powerful Object Relational Mapper or ORM) with Flask applications. It provides a set of tools and features that make it easier to interact with relational databases from within a Flask app, while leveraging SQLAlchemyâ€™s advanced database management capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role of Flask-SQLAlchemy:\n",
        "ORM (Object Relational Mapping):\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy allows you to map Python objects to database tables. This means that instead of writing raw SQL queries, you interact with the database using Python classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It translates Python objects into database records and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplified Database Configuration:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy integrates seamlessly with Flask, managing the database connection and configurations through Flaskâ€™s configuration system.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can configure your database URI and settings directly in the Flask app, such as which database to connect to, and connection settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///mydatabase.db'\n",
        "Session Management:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy handles database sessions for you. It uses SQLAlchemy's session mechanism to manage transactions and database operations like adding, committing, and rolling back changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The session allows you to work with the database in a transactional manner (commit and rollback).\n",
        "\n",
        "Model and Schema Definition:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy makes it easy to define models (classes that represent database tables) with db.Model.\n",
        "\n",
        "These models automatically map to the database schema, making it easier to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "class User(db.Model):\n",
        "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
        "    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)\n",
        "    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)\n",
        "Database Migrations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy works well with Flask-Migrate (which uses Alembic) to handle database migrations. This allows you to evolve your database schema over time by automatically generating migration scripts and applying them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compatibility with Multiple Databases:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy can be used with several relational databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others. You only need to change the database URI to connect to different databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Querying and Filtering:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy provides easy-to-use query APIs for fetching and filtering data. It supports the full range of SQLAlchemy queries while making it more accessible to Python developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "user = User.query.filter_by(name=\"Alice\").first()\n",
        "Advantages of Using Flask-SQLAlchemy:\n",
        "Ease of Use: It simplifies database interactions with ORM, so you donâ€™t need to write raw SQL queries for common operations.\n",

        "\n",
        "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "ans. Flask Blueprints are a way to organize your Flask application into smaller, modular components. A blueprint defines a collection of routes, templates, static files, and other components that can be used in an application. By using blueprints, you can make your Flask application more maintainable, scalable, and structured.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Are Flask Blueprints Useful?\n",
        "Modularization:\n",
        "Blueprints allow you to break down your application into smaller, reusable components. For instance, you might have separate blueprints for different parts of your app, such as:\n",

        "\n",
        "admin for administrative functions\n",
        "\n",
        "api for API routes\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability:\n",
        "You can define a blueprint once and reuse it across different applications or different parts of the same app. This is especially helpful for large applications or when you have multiple similar projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Separation of Concerns:\n",
        "Blueprints let you separate different parts of the application logically. For example, keeping your user-related routes in one blueprint and product-related routes in another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintainability:\n",
        "Keeping related views, templates, and static files in separate blueprints makes the codebase easier to maintain and update.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Flask request object is used to access incoming HTTP request data in Flask applications. It contains all the information about the current request, such as form data, query parameters, headers, cookies, and files. It is available globally for each request and provides an easy way to interact with the data sent by the client (browser, mobile app, etc.).\n",

Securing a Flask API is crucial to ensure that only authorized users can access your endpoints, data is transmitted safely, and potential attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injection) are mitigated.

It is essentially a dictionary-like object that allows you to store and retrieve information for a specific user, which persists between requests as long as the session remains active. The session is usually used to store small pieces of data, like user authentication details, user preferences, or other temporary data, without needing to use a database."
